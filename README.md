# NgSite - an example for a single page application (SPA) made with AngularJs

This application represents a compact admin tool.
It does not require a backend - it uses a simple simulation with JSON files.
The project is made to present the power of AngularJs. It should show Angular beginners how to build a complete but not complex Angular web portal.
