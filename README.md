NgSite - an example for a single page application (SPA)
--
The application does not require a backend - it uses a programmatic simulation for this.

To install the project, it must be copied to the corresponding directory on a Web server.

With the project i would like to present the power and compactness of AngularJs.  In addition, it's helpful for beginners to have a complete, but not complex, web portal before the eyes.

The NgSite is made with the following basic technologies:
--
- AngularJs v1.6.3
- Bootstrap v3.3.7
- UI Bootstrap v2.5.0

The NgSite has following futures
--
- Responsive design
- Multilingual capacity
- Dynamic tables with paging
- Cache for table content
- Lazy loading for controllers and services
- Proven template-based layout (navi, content, header, footer)
- and other things...
